# Dental-X-Ray-Classification

The main steps that are performed for this code are as follow:

Pre-process, prepare and visualize a real-world dental X-ray dataset.
Load and train AlexNet (Deep Learning Model) for X-ray image classification.
Monitor the performance of a model during training using the Keras API to avoid underfitting/overfitting model for better results.
Visualizing and Evaluating classification models
